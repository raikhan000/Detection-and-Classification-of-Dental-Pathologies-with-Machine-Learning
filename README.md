# Detection-and-Classification-of-Dental-Pathologies-with-Machine-Learning
This study focuses on implementing a two-stage object detection approach:  
1) Teeth position detection (T1–T8 for the upper jaw, B1–B8 for the lower jaw).  
2) Pathology identification, including caries, pulpitis, periodontitis, prostheses, and treated teeth.  
By integrating deep learning techniques, this research aims to contribute to the automation of dental diagnostics, improving efficiency and accuracy in clinical practice.
